# Linear System Equation Solver Android Application

An Android Application developed by Team Minions (Merna Maher Ghaly - Mina Gamal Khella - Mayar Ahmed Alaa ElDin - Naira Wahied Gharieb) to solve Linear Systems of two and three variables. The user takes a photo of the equations and the application gives the solution back.

We used **Tesseract OCR** library for letters and numbers detection . In addition to that , we used **OpenCV** for images enhancement .
A demo video in Arabic to describe how the application works: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggjOMqFn8Fg&feature=youtu.be

Possible future enhancements for the project :
-----------------------------------------------
<br>1)Work with more complex equations.</br>
<br>2)Work with hand-written equations.</br>
<br>3)Work with scrambled papers (improve image enhancement).</br>

Note that our project is not completely accurate in solving but we hope to further improve it in the future.


This project is our participation in the 1st Computer Vision Competition held at Ain Shams University .
